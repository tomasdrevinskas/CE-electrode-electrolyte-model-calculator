# CE-electrode-electrolyte-model-calculator
In this repository there is a project with a computational tool that finds out the voltage drop on the electrode-electrolyte interface during capillary electrophoresis separations. It can also calculate how much oxygen, hydrogen are generated and how much of different ions are released from the electrode into the solution.
